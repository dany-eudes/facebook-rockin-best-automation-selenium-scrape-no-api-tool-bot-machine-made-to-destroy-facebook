0.1.0
=====
- the file 'bot.rb' has been splitted:
  - settings.rb (should not change often)
  - debug.rb (run to debug FB instance)
  - bot.rb (run to do autolike/autocomment/autoshare)
  - suicide.rb (run to delete all your posts)
- set_*.rb files have been renamed to lang_*.rb (also inside these files; SetCZ=>LangCZ, SetEN_US=>LangEN_US)
- go_home() replaced by navigate_to(homepage_url)
- timeline() can now load both the homepage and the profile timeline
- timeline() does not navigate to homepage automatically, it expects the page to be already loaded before (homepage or a profile)
- timeline() does not raise "no more posts" exception, but returns normally - empty array

How to migrate from the previous version:

- make a backup
- get fresh files (git pull && git reset --hard)
- update settings.rb from the backup
- update bot.rb from the backup; the logic has not changed, but you have to explicitly call "fb.navigate_to fb.homepage_url" before calling the fb.timealine(60) now
